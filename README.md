### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm 26zl, and welcome to my little corner on GitHub! ðŸ˜Š 

I'm currently studying IT, with main interest in Cybersecurity, ethical hacking, backend development, and both Windows and Linux systems.

## Current projects that will be added to GitHub end of 2024:

1. **Windows Tweaking Tool**: A Java-based tool enabling users to apply various tweaks to Windows, encompassing security enhancements, privacy adjustments, gaming optimizations, UI modifications, and other general tweaks. It includes several batch and PowerShell scripts. 

2. **Vulnerability Scanner**: Developed in Python, this scanner identifies vulnerabilities across networks. 
   
3. More to come! ðŸ§ 

Follow my journey towards becoming a Cybersecurity analyst! ðŸ˜Ž 

I'm always open to meeting new people and collaborating on exciting projects, so feel free to reach out to me!
